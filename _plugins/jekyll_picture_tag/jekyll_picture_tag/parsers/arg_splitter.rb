    # This class takes in the arguments passed to the liquid tag, and splits it

    # To handle quotes and backslash escaping, we have to parse the string by
    # characters to break it up correctly. I'm sure there's a library to do
    # this, but it's not that much code honestly. If this starts getting big,
    # we'll pull in a new dependency.
