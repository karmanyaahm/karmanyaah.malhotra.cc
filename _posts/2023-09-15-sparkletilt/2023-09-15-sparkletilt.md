I made a Longhorn shaped level with Addressable RGB LEDs (Neopixels) and it's also an Arduino!!!!

A lot of my reasoning and instructions for making this board can be found on this (very very preproduction) workshop I'm writing on how to make this board: <https://workshops.hackclub.com/external-preview/karmanyaahm/onboard/pcb_level_4/>

TODO: add more info from video in text form, post schematics and source code on GitHub??

## Notes

None of this would've been possible without the following individuals and groups. Huge thanks to:
- TODO: Code on GitHub, link to libraries
- Hugo Hu for his Corgi Arduino design
- Hack Club for inspiring and funding this 
- Kognise for the cool header photo editing
