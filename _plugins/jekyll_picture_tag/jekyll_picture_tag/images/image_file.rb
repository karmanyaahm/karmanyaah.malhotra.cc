module PictureTag
  # Basically a wrapper class for vips. Handles image operations.
  # Vips returns new images for Crop, resize, and autorotate operations.
  # Quality, metadata stripping, and format are applied on write.
  #
  # This deserves to be two classes and a factory, one for normal vips save and
  # one for magicksave. This is illustrated by the fact that stubbing backend
  # determination logic for its unit tests would basically require
  # re-implementing it completely.
  #
  # I'm planning to implement standalone imagemagick as an alternative to vips,
  # so when I add that I'll also do that refactoring. For now it works fine and
  # it's not too bloated.
