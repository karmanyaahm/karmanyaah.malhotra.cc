A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.

In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",

    and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
    starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
    when ripe.
